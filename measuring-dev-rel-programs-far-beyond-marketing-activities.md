# Measuring dev rel programs far beyond marketing activities

## Summary:

* Ways to measure your developer programs in terms of acquisition, engagement and satisfaction, but far away from marketing. 
  * More focused on a community perspective.
* Dev rel is about building relationships. 
  * Department you came from but always have in mind the real mission and why you were hired as a dev rel and not as a marketing specialist. 
  * ‘Cause dev rel is about building relationships, and it’s about community. 
* It’s really really nice that you track things related to marketing but don’t only do that. 
* Be near your developers and go to the same places with them. 
  * Try to get the whole picture. 
* Understanding metrics take a lot of time.
* Needs to get the domain knowledge 
* DevRels need to interpret numbers to get insight for your community.

## Scribbles:

### Dev roles are really diverse. 

* A dev rel can be hired by a soft foundation. 
* They can be hired by a company. 
* They can be hired because they want to manage open source projects. 
* Or just proprietary software. 
* Makes it really, really difficult to bring up a standard way of metrics. 
* Dev rel roles can report to many different departments and those departments have different ways, and different KPIs to measure success.

### Dev rel roles are connected 

* They’re hired by a foundation. 
* They're hired for a company. 
* They report to marketing 
* They report to engineering. 
* Mission of a dev rel is always to build relationships with developers. 
* Developers can be seen in many different profiles or personas. 
* At the end, everything is related to community issues and ways to measure community. 

## Measuring acquisition 

* We can measure the developer growth by software product/project. 
* Real examples from the CHAOSS community. 
* Try to analyze the developer retention rate or the developer bounce rate.
* Example - Software GrimoireLab, Open source
  * Activity -&gt; community -&gt; Attraction and retention. 
  * Measure Git, ’cause we are fond of our community, it’s really engaged, it does a lot of Git code, for instance, and that’s a lot of Git commits. 
  * You can see the attracted developers and the last committed developers over a period of time.

### Measuring engagement 

* Take a look at the data sources about all the different challenges the developer community faces.
* All the different data sources are aggregated, all the different channels where our community is. 
* We can define if my community is a contributors community, is a user community, is a maintainer community, or any other type of community you would like to profile. 
* Depends on a lot of domain knowledge. 
* Define a personas pattern.

### Developer engagement by software product or project 

* See the most active community and the most engaged community project among the other ones. 
* Identify which projects had at some point some activity and then were left like the one on the prospect. 
* What happened then? 
* What did we do wrong?
* Or what can we do better in order to improve that engagement with the project itself?

### Measuring developer satisfaction

* Uber OPSO use case 
* OPSO - open source program office. 
  * Where open source and all the related activities related with open source are centralized and growing inside a company. 
* Uber wanted to know how efficient they were in answering, enclosing, and merging pull requests. 
* They wanted to measure GitHub in this case. 
* They wanted to know how fast they were when measuring Uber developers versus non-Uber developers. 
* Turns out that they tend to merge non-Uber developers took them more time when, rather than when, they wanted to merit a Uber developer pull request.
