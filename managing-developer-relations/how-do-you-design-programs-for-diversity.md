## Summary:

* Design thinking - Programme Design Thinking
* Vision 
* Understanding 
  * Knowing why you are doing something. 
  * Understand what problem you are solving 
  * What context in which the problem exists. 
* Define
  * Who is the target audience? 
* Ideate 
  * Finding the best idea. 
* Test
  * Testing the idea.
* Leverage
  * How can we maximise benefits?
* This process helps in becoming a better organizer, and helps to be a better leader then eventually leads to creation of something meaningful.

## Scribbles:

‌

### Design Thinking Framework 

* Brings you through to integrate the needs of the users, understand the possibilities of technology, and the requirements of business need to come to a solution that can meet all of that. 
* How can we use this, how can we copy this, and apply it to the programs?
* Mistakes many people make is to jump straight from ideation straight to execution.
* Without a very mindful approach to understanding why we are doing this and what problem we are solving, it is very easy to be pulled in a different direction like I was. 

### Vision

* Questions to ask … 
  * Why are you doing this? 
  * What are your goals? 
  * What are the desired outcomes?
* Vision helps with understanding if we’re solving the right problem. 
* DevRels can solve a lot of all the problems - not all problems are the right problems to solve. 
* Having a strong vision sets the foundation, helps set the right direction
* Understand what sort of metrics that will be important for you. 

### Understand

* Questions to ask…
  * What is the problem?
  * How are people solving the problem now? 
  * Why are the current solutions inadequate
* Not everyone learn how to code to become software engineers. Some of them just want to learn because it’s fun. 
  * Some of them want to learn to enhance their current role. 

### Define 

* It's between the more abstract research and vision with the very tangible execution strategy. 
* Define is understanding who our audience is, what are their hopes and dreams and fears, and how can we reach out to them. 
* Helps in focusing on who exactly I’m helping. 

User Persona

* User Persona is related to your vision and also what problem you’re solving.

‌  


### IDEATE

* Questions to ask
  * What are all the possible ideas?
  * Which is the “best” idea?
  * What idea gives you the shortest feedback loop?
* Find out what is the best idea to pursue given the constraints and the resources you have. 
* Learning is to prioritize ideas before a short feedback loop. 
  * A feedback loop is a time taken to plan, execute and learn from that experience. 
* So ideas for a short feedback loop helps you learn more faster. 
* Talk to different people to help me refine the idea. 

### Test

* Questions to ask.. 
  * What is the best way to test this? 
  * What are the risks involved? 
  * What did you learn?  

Testing Methods

* Feedback from users 
* Run a small event 
* Creating prototype  

### Leverage

* Leverage is simply to squeeze any ounce of, in fact, other things that you are already doing.
* What are some other goals that you can achieve? 
* What are some of the momentum that you can create from the things that you are already doing?
