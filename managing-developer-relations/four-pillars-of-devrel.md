  To devise a DevRel strategy, one must understand their company's needs and the
  tactics that can be used to meet them. Let's take a look at the four pillars
  to understand all of this in a better way.

### Four Pillars

* Outreach
* Community
* Product
* Education and support

#### What are the pillars for? 

* Pillars are about what you will do in your DevRel programme. 
* The strategic initiatives to meet the program's initiative are usually chosen from one or more of the given pillars 

### DevRel vs Developer Experience

* Once you take a close look at the four pillars, it's visible there are two halves -- outreach and community which is usually covered by developer relations, then we have product and education/support which is covered by developer experience. 
* DevRel programme needs to consider all four.
* A mix of tactics chosen will depend on the broader strategy. This brings us to the _**AAARRRP funnel**_, which you can take a deeper look at in the scribble linked below.

#### Example of why the divide b/w DevRel and Dev Experience isn't always clear.

* One can have a great outreach program, arguably DevRel, to drive people from awareness to acquisition -- a better approach would be to have high-quality documentation, which arguably falls under developer experience. 



### Outreach

* Broadly, covered in two ways 
  * Online 
  * In-person
* Activities are done in order to drive customers. 
* Makes people aware of the products and helps them get a better overall understanding. 
* Helps people to overcome initial objections and push through to some commitment to using it. 

### Community

* Community is about creating a framework that enables developers to be successful with your product. 
* Having an active community around the product is ðŸ”‘ for many developers.
* Provides the evidence that people, other than the organization selling it are using it for various use-cases.
* Helps in amplifying efforts of DevRel programme. 

> _Community has a role to play in each stage but itâ€™s most focused on moving developers from the acquisition through to the product stages. The social proof, additional support, and supplemental activities that a community delivers are all crucial in helping developers to feel comfortable about committing to your product._

### Product

* DevRel teams can find themselves in marketing, engineering or anywhere based on the organization's goals. 
* Now, DevRel in the product might sound a little unconventional for beginners as to what role can they have in shaping the product -- right? 
* Developer advocacy is more talked about than developer evangelism, partly because advocacy is a two-way thing. 
  * Dev advocates, advocate the products to developers but also advocate on the behalf of developers in product discussions and ensure that developer needs are heard.
* DevRel teams should focus on ensuring that developer needs are hears and should represent the voice of developers in product discussions.
* In terms of dev funnel - DevRel's role in the product should focus on moving someone from activation to becoming a committed user.  

### Education and support

* This domain can likely be covered by several different teams.
  * Dedicated support team
  * Developer success team
  * Developer education team
  * DevRel itself. 
* Whether or not DevRel is directly involved in it, they should take account of activities necessary to educate developers and support them outside of the company's formal/dedicated channels
* DevRel team's role should be to support developers who aren't yet customers, to provide them with educational materials that the company's tech writes wouldn't cover. 
* To ensure that developers are more productive -- strong education and support is a must.
