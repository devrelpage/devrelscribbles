## Summary: 

* One of the main things to always remember is that each event -- online, _**hybrid, or physical**_, it's those _**little decisions**_ made by the core team that can eventually make the event successful and now it depends on how you set the _**metrics for success**_. 
* In an online world - if someone is online and present â€”they're likely willing to be approached. 
* Reaching out to speakers is hard for in-person events. 
* Try to think _**more**_ about _**reach than attendance as a metric**_. 
* Having a global staff helps to reach global audiences.

## Scribbles

### ðŸš© Takeaways

* It's really _**difficult to know who to approach IRL**_ \(in real life\), online events make this easier, especially for introverts.
* People _**were left with less time during COVID**_, _**not more time**_.
* In an online world - _**if someones is online and present**_ â€”they're likely _**willing to be approached**_.
* People from niche interests can come together, overcoming geographical limitations.
* Letting people who wanted to attend but couldn't due to cost issues.
* Long-tail of talks being available on Youtube long after the event.
* Online events are driving up the quality of the talks, giving speakers more confidence, helping them overcome stage fright, etc.
* Online brings more diversity on how to deliver talks, it is more accessible, and being able to educate/teach/talk in so many different formats
* Noticed a trend of online communities \(Slacks, Discords\) staying more active after events, Kevin's communities have noticed the opposite, ie, less or no activity after events. 

> There is more organic engagement in the community in between events. People stay connected because they remain on the platform, instead of physically going to a different space and disconnecting from the community. -- @Jonathan Gottfried from MLH

* Now that events have transcended geographical limitations, it would be really useful to think across timezones, languages, etc to expand the potential audience to the whole world. 
* Think about accessibility in demographics where people might have limitations for example connectivity speed.
* Having a global staff helps to reach global audiences.

### What are some positive outcomes in taking events online, What would you retain?

* _**Recording stuff**_ for later reference.
* People have been _**making more meaningful connections**_ because everyone seems more 'equal'.
* People are more receptive to being approached.
* People took respite in online events due to the disruption in their lives due to COVID.
* COVID forced us to pivot, put resources to best use.

### **What do you see as the future of Hybrid Events?**

* Hybrid events are hard, just like hybrid workplaces!
  * Going to have to get really really creative.
* Events are social experiences, talks are important but not the main thing.
* Harder to bridge the gap between in-person and online.
* Depends on the nature of the event. Easy for hackathons, harder for conferences.
* Serendipity online vs in-person may not have a lot of overlap.
* We need to know what part of an in-person event will get value from having an online component, taking the whole event online may not make perfect sense or be feasible.
* Challenges of covering in-person events via video and taking them online fully.
* Reaching out to speakers is hard for in-person events.
* Issues finding accessible and inclusive venues - some people can't go to bars for example.
* Inclusive timings are still a challenge. Everyone's being cautious about hybrid events!

### **How can we get more people to attend events?**

* Try to think _**more**_ about _**reach than attendance as a metric**_.
* _**Reusing assets**_ from events afterwards.
* Online events might have greater reach post-event, youtube videos for example. - Low attendance could be because of Zoom fatigue. 
* Rethink online event as not just a Zoom call, but maybe say as a Youtube playlist.
* People look for social aspects in events, if that can be replicated online, then it might be helpful.
* An event needs to offer high-quality social contact.
* Content is a hook, not the full reason to attend. 
* Often there's not a real good engagement strategy for IRL events.

> We need to rethink the success metric. In the past an event's success used to be measured by "how many people attended" there is a real opportunity here and now to go beyond that. You can have low attendance numbers and still be considered a success because you can now measure other things now, like engagement. - @Kevin
