# Solving internal technical documentation at Spotify

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/uFGCaZmA6d4" caption="Video" %}

## Summary:

* The Hero’s Journey and how they are solving technical documentation at Spotify.
  * treating docs like code. ‌  
* What have we learned?
  * Keep focused on the key problem
  * Keep the solution simple so it just works? 
  * Fiercely optimize for the engineer.
  * Enable others to build on the platform
  * Standardize and centralize.  
* What’s next?
* They need to work more on trust and maintenance.
* Open-sourcing TechDocs
* They haven't solved yet in-code documentation

## Scribbles:

‌

### Ordinary world

* At Spotify, they have about 1,500 engineers and a lot of the engineers are making tours or platforms for other engineers at Spotify. 
* There’s a great need for technical documentation. 
* Spotify’s culture of the teams can work in the way they want, it happened over time that when teams realized they wanted to do some technical documentation
  * they would do it sometimes in Confluence
  * they would do it sometimes in Google Docs
  * There was tons of technical documentation spread everywhere. 
* And of course, then other engineers looking for this documentation, couldn’t find it when they needed it. 
* They had a search engine, but it didn’t work that well. And it broke after a while, so it was a sort of chaotic situation.

‌

#### Is this a problem worth solving? 

* Not finding the information that you need -- number three blocker. So yes, it’s a problem worth solving.
* Their technical writers were spread around the infrastructure teams and they were solving smaller problems within the individual groups. 
* They weren’t solving the big problem for Spotify at all, they were solving individual problems. 

‌

### Call to adventure

* Their call to adventure started when one of their writers spotted a talk that Google had done about three years ago, at the docs conference.
* Google had exactly the same problems that had been spotted in Spotify's organization  
* Coincidentally, they were about a week away from Hack Week at Spotify. 
  * they decided to try and just do something like what they saw Google had done.
* And they did that and it worked out quite well, and they showed it off to people.
* What would it take to do this really well here at Spotify? 

### Refusal of the call. 

* Docs Like Code approach. 

> _**Could I give up my craft, in a way, that I’ve been working with for years? And of course the answer is yes, otherwise I wouldn’t be here today.**_

### The mentor. 

* There were three technical writers in a team.
* And they had a hypothesis. 
* They did some user research to validate the hypothesis that they had, not only for the solution but for mainly the problem. 

#### Crossing the threshold.

* They got started,
  * They had their team 
  * They were gonna build something like what they had done in Hack Week and something like the Google thing. 
  * And so they spent weeks and weeks with complex designs and processes, complicated architectural design and this was it. 
  * Within a couple of weeks, they got out an alpha version of what they called TechDocs. 

### Challenges

* **Discoverability and findability**
  * Findability, you know what you’re looking for, that’s search. 
  * Discoverability, you don’t know what you’re looking for, but you want to discover it, that’s a problem of technical documentation. 
* **Trust, how can you trust…** 
  * How can you trust what you find?
* **Maintenance**
  * It’s very easy to create documents, but or documentation, but how do you maintain it afterwards. That often gets forgotten. 
* **Feedback loop**
  * That is about somebody making comments on a piece of documentation, that those comments would get to the one who, or the team who owns that documentation and they will correct it and then you get a feedback loop.
* **Hidden knowledge**
  * That's many engineers having lots of knowledge that’s in their heads and it’s not shared. 
* **Ownership** 
  * is a bit connected to no handover process. 
  * Documentation has to be owned. If it’s not owned, it will absolutely decay over time. 
  * And then a handover process needs to be in place otherwise you won’t have ownership eventually. 
* **Used and useful**
  * Teams who create documentation really wanna know that it’s used and that it’s useful for their own, you know, they put a lot of work into putting some documentation up and they need to know.
* **Adoption and engagement** 
  * There are often different use cases, and different needs, you have to think about that you can’t just ignore that. 
* **Engineers get stuck and they want to use documentation to get unstuck,** 
  * Then you wanna help them fast. 
  * They want to get unstuck fast, so that really is the key problem underneath all this. 

### Docs Like Code Plus

* Basic how-to-do tech documentation at scale.
* Enabling the engineers so just make it super easy, the documentation is as close to the code as possible.
*  It’s in markdown, so it’s super easy and they provide navigation.
* Super easy for engineers, in line with their workflow completely in the tools that they’re using every day.
* Information card \(trust card eventually\) 
  * For each documentation site, you’ve got the owner, they get that from GitHub, the doc was last updated, they get that from GitHub, the open issues again.
* Feedback loop, 
  * Users click that and they go directly into GitHub and they can submit a PR 
  * Users create and highlight a piece of text and select that for opening a GitHub issue. 
* Doc home page
  * Addressing discoverability and findability. 

### Reward

* **Reward is the impact that they’re having in the organization and the love that they get for TechDocs.**
* Docs Like Code plus -- they’re really having an impact on the organization.
* Lots of positive feedback.

‌

### The Road Back

**What’s their success factors?** 

* A cross-functional team
  * Was absolutely essential.
  * They were solving a real problem in the organization. 
* Embraced Docs Like Code
* Quick development of a minimum, lovable product. 
* Good adoption 
* Collaboration 
* They had a clear and inspiring vision.

### The Resurrection

* This is convincing other technical writers that Docs Like Code is the way to go! Okay, no one got that. 

### Return with the Elixir. 

* So this is return, the elixir is the Holy Grail
*  Docs Like Code has been the Holy Grail. ‌
