## Summary: 

* One of the main things to always remember is that each event -- online, _**hybrid, or physical**_, it's those _**little decisions**_ made by the core team that can eventually make the event successful and now it depends on how you set the _**metrics for success**_.

### **Online Event**

* Accessible.
* Cheaper.
* Logistic ease.
* Low barriers to entry.
* Less risky.
* Lots of room for creativity without investing a lot.
* More room for creativity without limitations of physical space.
* More options to comfortably interact \(Text chat, audio, video\)
* GREAT MEMES ONLINE!
* Online events attract more people.
* People overcome hesitation to attend.
* More comfortable online - you can choose your own engagement level.
* People who have mobility issues can attend \(excellent point\)
* Speakers always turn up.

### **Hybrid Events** 

* **Emilia:** - Events are social experiences, talks are important but not the main thing. -- Harder to bridge the gap between in-person and online. - For Emilia, online and in-person would serve different purposes.  
* **Jon:** - Depends on the nature of the event. Easy for hackathons, harder for conferences. - Serendipity online vs in-person may not have a lot of overlap. - We need to know what part of an in-person event will get value from having an online component, taking the whole event online may not make perfect sense or be feasible.  
* **Suze:** - Challenges of covering in-person events via video and taking them online fully. - Reaching out to speakers is hard for in-person events. - Issues finding accessible and inclusive venues - some people can't go to bars for example. - Inclusive timings are still a challenge ****everyone's being cautious about hybrid events!

### **How can we get more people to attend events?**

* Try to think more about reach than attendance. 
* Reusing assets from events afterwards.  
* Online events might have greater reach post-event, youtube videos for example. - Low attendance could be because of Zoom fatigue.  
* Rethink online event as not just a Zoom call, but maybe say as a Youtube playlist. Async vs Sync.  
* People look for social aspects in events, if that can be replicated online, then it might be helpful.
