**Hybrid Events:** 

**Emilia:** - Events are social experiences, talks are important but not the main thing. - Harder to bridge gap between in-person and online. - For Emilia, online and in-person would serve different purposes.   
**Jon:** - Depends on the nature of the event. Easy for hackathons, harder for conferences. - Serendipity online vs in-person may not have a lot of overlap. - We need to know what part of an in-person event will get value from having an online component, taking the whole event online may not make perfect sense or be feasible.   
**Suze:** - Challeneges of covering in-person events via video and taking them online fully. - Reaching out to speakers is hard for in-person events. - Issues finding accessible and inclusive venues - some people cant go to bars for example. - Inclusive timings is still a challenge.\[22:19\]everyone's being cautious about hybrid events!
