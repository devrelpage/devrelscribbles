> As you can see, developer relations is highly cross-functional, dynamic, and includes a wide breadth of skills and responsibilities. According to [Bear Douglas](https://slack.engineering/defining-a-career-path-for-developer-relations/), Director of Developer Relations at Slack, developer relations is “_an interdisciplinary role that sits in a border space between product, engineering, and marketing_”.



* Besides product management, DevRel is the only role that might be a part of various kinds of meetings.

### 3 C's of Developer Relations

#### Community 

* Building personal connections with developers
* Growing awareness of the platform

#### Coding 

* Creation of resources to be used by developers
* Great way to build trust
* Forms the foundation for demonstrations of your platform 

#### Content 

* Creating reference materials like documentation, guides, blogs and videos
* Helps in extending the reach and educating the community

### Difficult to define DevRel. Why? 

* Large breadth of tasks and responsibilities comes within developer relations.
* Responsibilities change within every company. 
* DevRel might be in different parts within the organization 
  * Engineering 
  * Product
  * Marketing
* DevRel is still a relatively new function for companies to have.
* Applicable to companies with developer-facing products. 
* Somewhat niche, makes it harder to define to people outside of the tech industry. 



### So, what is developer relations?

> _**The art of developer relations is to actually build authetic relationships within your community without selling or marketing to them.**_

* The purpose of developer relations is to build relationships with and enable our technical communities. 

### Why does it exist?

* One of the ways to put it would be that it "always exists".
* Having a product where users are developers, you are already into developer relations then, even if you have a dedicated team or not. 
* So, even if your organization doesn't have a DevRel, there must be someone writing technical documentation, code samples, connecting with developers to solve an issue. 
* While developing a product, one of the first steps as a developer is to create documentation, samples, uses cases to get started.
