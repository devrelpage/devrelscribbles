  In this talk from DevRelCon London 2019, Jo Cook talks about The Good Docs
  Project and Google’s Season of Docs are working to make it easier to create
  excellent open-source documentation.

## Summary:

* Find out the **Problem.**
* **Restate the problem** 
  * Finding more resources 
  * Developers to miss out steps
  * Developers are familiar with the technical terminologies that they use. 
  * Users that really know what their own expectations and needs are.
  * Users that are actually going to be using the documentation.
* **Figure out what puts people off?**
* **Figure out a new solution.** 
* Encouraging help with documentation for your project encourages empathy and improves diversity, both of which I think are very good things.
* Good Docs Project
  * **Identify all of the elements of good documentation that a project needs.**
  * **Establish a minimum viable docset.**
  * **Create a community of writers, users, and techies**

## Scribble: 

### Projects are dying

* Open source projects are dying. I
* On GitHub, 64% of those projects rely on just one or two developers to survive.
* We then take into account that these people are really often doing day jobs and running these projects in their spare time, or in a very under-resourced way. 
* They’re not very diverse! 
* The ratio of women in IT is between 17 and 25%, but in open source, it’s between 0.1 and 5%. 
* What that means is that there’s a big pooling of talent, which could be being mined for participation in projects.

‌

#### Documentation is often severely lacking

* It’s seen as being a big barrier to participation, adoption, and contribution. 

‌

#### Getting help is tricky, and again

* An open-source survey from a few years ago said that “Incomplete or outdated documentation is a big problem. 
  * “93% of respondents spotted problems with documentation
  *  60% of those people say they rarely or never contribute.”

### They’re not dying, they are under-resourced!

* Open source projects, they’re not dying, but they are under-resourced, not very well-documented, and they don’t attract diverse contributions.

‌

#### How do we go about fixing this problem? 

* **Finding more resources** 
  * It is about creating more time for developers. It’s not about money. 
  * How can we give developers more time to do what they want to do? 
    * Whilst also improving project documentation‌
* The GitHub Open Source Survey from 2017 identified that documentation is a really, really.…. 
* Good way of getting people involved in projects,
* Good way of establishing more inclusive and accessible communities. 
* brings in people from different communities, and encouraging contributions to more than just the code makes the project a lot more resilient in the long run. 
* **Developers to miss out steps**
  * Users are the best people to write documentation.
  * Easy for developers to miss out on steps because they’re very, very close to their software.
* **Developers are familiar with the technical terminologies that they use.** 
* **Users that really know what their own expectations and needs are.**
* **Users that are actually going to be using the documentation.**

### What things put people off?

* When you’re writing documentation, or when you’re trying to get them to help you, when you’re trying to get them to contribute.
* High barriers to entry.
  *  What we’re talking about here is, is it easy for people to contribute to your documentation? 
* Users are more likely to help you ensure that your documentation covers these early, painful setup stages.
  * They’re actually not all that focused on the endgame. 
  * They just want to get things done. 

‌  


### How do we reduce the barrier to entry? 

#### Allow easy ways for users to contribute 

* Forms to make a pull request to make grammatical changes... really? 
* Preferably so they don’t need to install additional software.
* Get their contribution live as quickly as possible. 
  * These contributions, small contributions, lead to bigger contributions.
* Acknowledge contributions, no matter how small they are, because they are important to the people that made them, and they’re important to your project.

‌  


#### Work with existing technical writers

* There are lots of technical writers out there with huge amounts of subject matter expertise. 
* They’re not secretaries. 
* As developers, your best bet is to really make friends with those technical writing people. 
* Provide workflows that make it easier to write good documentation, and find all of those existing good practices.  ‌

### Good Docs Project

* **Identify all of the elements of good documentation that a project needs.** 
  * Tutorials, how-tos, references, technical documentation. 
  * Providing best practice resources and templates for each of them. 
* **Establish a minimum viable docset**
  * Designed to help you create a baseline set of docs. 
* **Create a community of writers, users, and techies**
  * Get practical tips and advice, and help for all parts of this project, of your process. 
  * Aim of increasing quality and consistency.
