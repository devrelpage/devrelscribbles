## Summary:

> ‚Äú_**I encourage everyone who hasn‚Äôt to see the value and actually connecting with your developers one-on-one so you can learn from their stories and feel their pain.‚Äù**_

* It doesn‚Äôt really matter if it‚Äôs on the phone or through video or in-person, 
  * as long as you‚Äôre kind of connecting one-on-one and asking them open-ended questions.
* Don‚Äôt Assume your developers 
  * **Want what you do** 
  * **Are all the same**
  * **Know your product**
* **Put on your researcher Hat** 
* **Make your finding in researchable format**
* **Include your stakeholders** -- 
  * don‚Äôt get overprotective by the process. 
* **Frame your findings to support your customers and business.** 

## Scribbles: 

* It‚Äôs important to tailor your DevRel initiatives to your company‚Äôs business model and your team structure. 
* Set up objectives for your team.

### Biggest challenges in DevRel

* Determining which of the numerous activities is the most leveraged,
* How should the docs be improved
* Move to the OpenAPI spec
* Writing code examples 
* Creating SDKs 
* Speaking at conferences 
* Fostering a dev community 
* Answering technical questions
* integrating with partners

Quote Our initial thought was, you know, we‚Äôre developers so we know what developers want. We‚Äôll just choose the things that seemed useful to us. Wrong. 

### üö© Takeaways:

### Don‚Äôt assume you know what developers want. 

* Generalize developers of your platform 
  * **1st Party Developers** -  Engineers that build integrations on our API. 
  * **2nd Party Developers** - Work on/for customers. 
  * **3rd Party Developers** - Build apps for many asana customers to use. 
* It can be difficult to actually track down the developers and get that first handful of meetings. 
* Really hard to understand the behaviour of your users until you have one-on-one conversations and meet with them and listen in person. 

### Don‚Äôt assume your developers know your product.

* Not everyone loves your product as much as you do. 
* Reevaluate our developer experience. 
  * Writing an object hierarchy doc to explain the elements of your product. 

### Don‚Äôt assume all of your developers are the same.

* Create distinct personas and expand each a bit more. 
* Creating different developer tracks for each group. 
* Packaging all of these developer interviews into case studies and presenting them to numerous teams across your organisation.

####  Importance of internal platform evangelism. 

* Cultivating a thriving developer ecosystem is difficult if you can‚Äôt get your internal teams excited about the product.  

### Ask the hard questions to a broader set of developers. 

* Choose your research methods and goals before you start talking to users. 
* Ask open-ended questions. 
  * Give people the space to speak their minds.
  * Get out of your own way, let your developers tell you what they experience.
* Come in with an open mind. 
  * If you come in with an opinion, you risk only hearing the evidence that supports that hypothesis. 

### Ways of gathering Developer Stories

* Interviewing developers. 
* Developer survey.
* Developer community 
* Feedback form
* Documentation
* Meeting and researching with 1st party, 2nd part and 3rd party developers. 

### Structure and organise your findings in a more actionable format 

* Organize the feedback into themes 
  * Each section was a different theme
  * Custom fields to track user stories by dev personas. 

### Include your stakeholders. 

### It‚Äôs also about customers and the business .. not just developers. 

* Start reframing some of the developers needs to encompass some of the broader customer and business needs. 
* Represent developers at company planning.
