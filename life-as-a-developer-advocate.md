#### Content

* A typical day of an advocate **may** go by in deciding the type of content that should be provided with the product. 
* A large portion of the product's success boils down to the content that goes with it. 
* Without the right content, it gets difficult to for developers to know what the product does, how does one get started with it, what can one build with it. 
* _**What content to make?**_  Should be among the first questions you ask.
* _**Who is the content for? Which users are we targeting?**_ 
* _**What do we want to achieve with this content?  --**_ metrics attached with it.
* Once all the questions are answers, one can have a better understanding and a clear bias on what content their team wants to create. 
* The story behind why the product is beneficial for the users, along with other similar products out there and giving an _**honest**_ comparison.
