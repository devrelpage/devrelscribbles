### Summary

* Understanding different programs at Paypal
  * There were developed gradually over time and not at once
* Internal tools help the Developer Advocates **be in sync with the latest technology** by getting them to build projects
* Building tools is especially beneficial for startups - do more with fewer people
* **Collecting metrics** is a great way to increase the efficiency
* Someone from the team should be in charge of what data needs to be collected and what tools need to be built around it. 

### Scribbles

* **Programs at Paypal**
  * \*\*\*\*[BattleHack](https://battlehack.org) - Themed Hackathon \(Winners go to San Jose!\)
  * [Commerce Factory](https://commercefactory.org) - Meetup Series of tech-focused talks on commerce
  * [Startup Blueprint](https://blueprint.paypal.com) - Startups get free processing for the first 18 months
  * [Start Tank](https://london.starttank.com) - Free office space to 6 startups for 6 months
  * [Braintree\_Talks](https://braintree-talks.com) - Talks series
* Did not start at once, **created all these overtime**
* **"We should create internal tools and services, and external-facing properties, in order to help the team deliver more, faster, and better than before."**
* To stay sharp your skills need training
  * Going and meeting tons of developers every day, you **need to keep up** with the technology.
  * You can't **stay up to date** if you don't have some projects to work on.
  * As the team grows, you need to do more with the same people every year - increasing efficiency.
  * **Eliminate the repetitive tasks** and simplify the process
* It is important especially for startups to build side projects - tools that simplify the process to do more
  * **Slack** - It was a side project build to help people at Flikr communicate effectively
* **Tools made for BattleHack**
  * Made a whole ticketing system with metrics that helped effectively to get the engagement rates of the audience.
    * This was extremely useful for the operations team that ran hackathons
    * Knew metrics for each city to target catering necessary stuff to avoid overselling or underselling the event
  * Check-in system was very useful to know how many actually attended the event
    * Eg.: For the first year had customized badges for everyone but 50% badges were never picked up
      * These were expensive
      * So came up with a solution of printing with transparent labels
      * Saved a lot of cost for the event! 
  * Started collecting information about each Hack being developed at the hackathon.
    * Analysed which product was being used in which hack.
    * Got to know how many people were interested in the technology.
    * Shared the information with the partners as well and it was extremely useful.
  * Clock, twitter wall etc were developed to encourage participants getting engaged with social media
* **Tools made for Startup Blueprint**
  * Developed a customised CRM tool to keep track of everything
  * Initially used a spreadsheet which became messy to converted it into a simple tool for everyone to use
* **Commerce Factory**
  * Made a ton of sample code repositories to standardize the experience of the tech talks
* **Other tools**
  * URL Shorteners
  * Sharktank apps
  * Metrics for iOS and Android
  * Hubot
  * Code of Conduct for the hackathon
* Got to play with a lot new tech
* **Why does this matter?**
  * If you're a startup, increasing the workforce is not the best way to increase efficiency
  * **With the same number of people in the team, they noticed**
    * **195% increase in tickets**
    * **223% increase in attendance**
    * **~115% of confirmed attendance**
    * **~65% of attendance presented**
      * **934 hacks being presented**
      * **487 of them were unique**
      * **Got to know the most popular languages and tools being used at the hackathons** 
  * **Doubled the number of events each year, with not so significant increase in hires**
    * **This is because they were able to do more with the same people each year.**
* Someone from the team should be in charge of strategising how to collect this data and how to build tools to help collect this data effectively.
