### A Rocking 🤘🏼Technical Keynote

* Big annual developer conference
* Bunch of announcements 
* Lots of software demos

#### What does it do? 

* _**Sets**_ the _**tone and gives purpose**_ to the whole event
* Collects the exposure, product roll-outs and features along with competitive analysis. 
* Helps in understanding the technical aspect. 

### How to rock the keynote? 

* Breaking down the keynote into a five-part agile process
* Applying those ⬆️ to _keynotiest_ presentation
* If you aren't preparing for a presentation, you might wanna change that.
* Get a "village" of people ready. \(A lot\) 
* 100 - 150 hours worth of time
* People resources to invest in...
  * Comms engineer
  * Speaking coach 
  * Engineers building software demos, more the merrier. 
  * Product managers

### Ideation

* Setting up work that has to happen before sorting the tasks.
* Making sure you have parts that are interconnected with each other throughout.
* Hashing out all the possibilities. 
* Something that eventually leads to good storytelling. 
* Identify the audience you are presenting to.
* Set a specific outline for the team.

#### Software Demos

* Aim should be about testifying to the truth of the claims.
* Basically to show the world that the thing you're announcing is capable of solving users problems as you claimed earlier.
*  Teaching everyone how to use your software or product to solve their problems
* Software demo specifications \(example below\) 

### Composition

* Say real words
* **Build working demos**
* **Sketch slide wireframes**
* Practice strong transitions
* **Insert session callouts**

#### Build working demos

* Weekly demos
  * This helps us make sure that everything is set up early -- the one in charge should be checking with the assigned engineers weekly
* Midpoint demo
  * Sets up review panel where everyone working on the demo, make sure they are progressing from software development pov.
  * Make sure everyone's hitting the messages/ comments that were outlined in the goals.

#### **Sketch slide wireframes**

* The presenter can track and evolve even before the graphics are done.
* Defer work on slides that might change

#### Session Callouts

* These are links to previous talks or sessions that you mentioned in the current keynote. Induces interaction and makes sure everything is interconnected. 



### Slide-craft

* The process of making sure that things go from those wireframes to really nice looking stuff.
* Beauty the slides
* Create interactive elements.
* Graphics are always better than bulleted words.

### Rehearsal

* Main difference between amateurs and professionals.
* What more to say...? You are going on stage after so much hard work...what's stopping you from a little rehearsal. 
* 🤘🏼rock bands rehearse whenever they get time. 

### Production

* Place where you need to start finalising and dropping the things that aren't adding up.
* Making sure engineers aren't using their real id's as it will be a live demo.
* Making sure the person in charge has all access to the keys
* Spare laptops, using bookmark where everyone behind the scene is sync.

> But I will tell you how I wrap it up, which is that if you do all this right, then you’ve got yourself an amazing keynote and you can talk to the people in your audience later and find that they’re ready to tell your story for you.
