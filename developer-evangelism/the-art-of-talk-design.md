## Scribble:

* _**Designing an effective talk, it’s the same process as designing an effective product.**_
* Company launches a product after doing the research of figuring out whether it’s a product that people want, yet, it’s something that happens all the time in our talks.
* Apply _**design thinking**_ when creating a new talk?
  * Design thinking is a way of thinking deliberately about what you’re creating and constantly reacting and reflecting on that.‌

### 5 Phases of Design thinking

* Empathise
* Define
* Ideate 
* Prototype 
* Test

### Empathise

* When building a product, we first try to understand who our users are and what our user needs are.
* It’s all about doing the research beforehand 
* Researching our users, who will be listening to it, who is the target audience? 

#### Audience

* Know about the events, the _**organizers**_ and most importantly, the _**attendees**_.
* What the background is, what prior knowledge they already might have. 
* Figure out what other speakers there are and also what they are talking about because that also influences people’s prior knowledge.

#### Format

* Understand what the logistical constraints are. 
  * How long is your time slot? 
  * What time will you be speaking at? 
  * What type of stage are you speaking on? 
  * Whether you’ll have access to Wi-Fi or audio?

#### Topic

* Write down what you already know about the content of your talk. 
  * What’s the title, the abstract, the key takeaways? 

### Define 

* Analyze all the observations that we’ve made so far and define what our core issues are. 
* So what are the problems that we’re trying to address with this new product?
  * it will always be about convincing the audience of whatever message you’re trying to get across but the angle of that message can be quite different.
  * It might be about teaching a new skill, it might be to convince people to use a specific product, 
  * it might be to inspire or motivate or frighten people to do or change something. 

####  Think, Feel and Do 

* Filling up columns of as many ideas as possible with the following questions.
* **Think** 
  * What do you want your audience thinking about?
  * What mindset do you want to change? 
  * What will the audience learn’
* **Feel**
  * How do you want the audience to feel?
  * Inspired, motivated, scared? 
* **Do** 
  * What actions do you want the audience to take?
  * What should they do after the talk?

### Ideate

* About generating as many ideas as possible and then limiting and choosing. 
* **Diverge** 
  * Try to generate as many ideas as possible while keeping the goals and the audience outcomes in the back of your mind. 
  * Write down all the possible ideas that will help achieve those goals and those outcomes.
* **Converge** 
  * Distilling all that information into something more usable.
  * Three techniques - prioritize, filter and cluster.
  * _**Prioritize**_
    * Putting the ideas that you have in order of importance, highlighting which ideas are the most important ones. 
    * Makes it easier to see which ones you might need to drop if you need to.
  * _**Filtering**_ 
    * Dropping off the talk, so which ones just don’t fit in, or things that aren’t as important as the rest, or that you know that you won’t get around to.
  * _**Clustering**_
    * Which ideas go naturally together? 
    * Can help you identify maybe the three topics that you can cover in a 20-minute talk and maybe you can know from…you can find out from it which topics you might need to ask for a 50-minute talk.

### Prototyping 

* Creating a scaled-down version of the end products, which you can then put in front of users and test with. 
* It’s about creating the bare minimum that will get you useful and valuable feedback without really wasting too much time.
* **Prototype your talk structure.‌**
  * Before even creating any slides-- Create an outline first. 
* **Beginning, middle, and end.**
  * _**Beginning**_
    * Start of the talk will be in that “what is” phase.
    * _**The Hook**_
      * Grad their attention.
    * _**The Goal**_
      * Convince them why they should listen.
  * _**Middle**_
    * Everything in b/w “what is” and “what could be”.
    * The Main Ideas & Journey 
      * Focus on what will bring the audience close to your goal.
  * _**End**_ 
    * “What could be” phase. 
    * _**The Summary**_ 
      * Recap the main ideas
    * _**The Kick**_
      * Give them something to remember

### Testing

* The testing phase is all about getting deliberate feedback about your product and then making sure that you ask the right questions to get that feedback.
* _**Prepare your feedback givers.**_
* **Prepare actual feedback questions.** 
  * What areas do you want feedback on? 
  * Is it about the timing of your talk, specific sections that you don’t feel are quite right?

> _**“Good presentations, good blog posts, good documentation, they’re all about understanding your audience and building the right message for them.”**_
