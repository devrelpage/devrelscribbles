# What are Scribbles?

DevRel Scribbles is a collection of notes from different DevRel Talks, Podcasts or anything that covers the best practices around DevRel. This can be exceptionally useful for someone trying to find out a specific topic, a specific thing they might have heard at a conference or just exploring different talks and do not have the time to listen to it wholly. Just read the notes and you're good to go on most parts!  

As one of the initiatives in [DevRel Page](https://devrel.page), I \([@yashovardhan](https://twitter.com/yashovardhan)\) thought it might be helpful to have different DevRel Talks documented at one place, sharing my notes, which have been extremely useful for me learning best practices to the core. 

As this repository grows, we will have a curated list of DevRel talks, segmented in different groups. Using the great search features of GitBook one can easily find out the best practices related to a specific field within minutes, skim through the notes and know what might be the best thing to do for a specific case!

My aim is to keep this repository open source and free to use for anyone in the community. The support and contributions here would be the thing driving it forward. Let me know if you're willing to help!

Questions/ Comments are always welcome! Reach out to me [directly](mailto:hi@devrel.page) or [submit an issue](https://github.com/yashovardhan/devrelscribbles/issues/new/choose)!
