## Scribbles:

### ðŸš© Takeaways: 

* Making opportunities where no one loses knowledge â€” everyone gains knowledge.
* Language itself can create a sense of hostility in some ways â€” and something that we should really take seriously.
* Expanding the term 'developer' opens up more opportunities for all.
* In order to get Go-To-Community integrated into the culture, you need to explain the metrics of community in terms of the known and functioning Go-To-Market strategy
* Tracking sentiment among developers â€” how did developers feel about the product and how did this influence the company strategy as a whole? \(Community + DevRel =. how you listen to your people!\) 
* _**Market side vs Community side: Old way of thinking  Better: Culture C: Synthesis of Market and Community.**_ 
* Sharing stories is one of the most important things we can do as community builders.
* The community team is in ways an R+D function

> "I dont think there is developer market, there is a developer community, and we need a community team to reach that"

* DevRel, Community, Marketing = all diff teams...or is DevRel & community manager = same team.
* _**Let the community do the marketing for you**_.



### Potential of having a great community

* Product growth 
* R&D 
* Marketing!



### If adoption is a future success â€” how can you tap into the future of your org through Go To Community.

* Marketing is not community building
