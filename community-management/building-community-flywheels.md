# Building community flywheels

{% embed url="https://orbit.love/blog/let-s-build-some-community-flywheels" caption="Blog" %}

‚Äå

## Summary:

* Every community builder out there has _**felt like this at some point** -- **finding that initial traction**_ with ongoing discussions can be hard.
  * Start with easy discussions, like introduction posts.
  * Experiment with writing posts
  * Creating a regular or ritual post
* The point with all of these mini flywheels is you can‚Äôt write stuff and expect magic to happen, _**you need to find actions to elevate your content.**_
* Great communities are _**built on**_ great _**ethics, kindness, and human behavior.**_
* Build all that  ‚¨ÜÔ∏è into your community, one small flywheel at a time. 
* Community guidelines do not make a great culture, actions do.

> **Having a flywheel that encourages great community culture not only encourages others to copy your ‚Äògood actions, but featuring selected community activities also indicates things you want to see within the community.**

* _**Giving and helping**_ are at the heart of great communities.
* Community culture does not happen overnight.
* Flywheels take practice, lots and lots of practice. Failing is a part of the process. 
* Flywheels are the things you do, the process, the daily tasks. 

## Scribble: 

* The main challenge faced by a community builder -- trying to achieve a constant flow of activity. 
* A thriving community is one that feels like there is the right balance of activity.  

### Ways to increase the quantity/quality of activity

* more discussions
* more members
* creating more value
* events that matter
* more connection 

### Community funnel of hope

‚Äå

* Consider funnels in terms of flywheels.
  * Effective flywheel creates energy
  * Energy leads to growth üìà

‚Äå

### Flywheel

‚Äå

* Instead of funnels, we are using flywheels
* An effective flywheel creates energy or traction, which then naturally leads to growth.
* The key is to figure out a set of actions that support each other and keep doing them

‚Äå

#### Build on Flywheel 

‚Äå

* bring energy and traction, usually in the form of more or higher quality activity
* add value to the community
* align with your goals and vision

‚Äå

#### Life of Flywheel

‚Äå

* A flywheel or multiple connected flywheels have grown and evolved there will be a time it comes to a natural end.
* What worked 5 or 10 years ago most certainly won‚Äôt work today.

‚Äå

### Takeaways

‚Äå

* flywheel actions like this will help you get where you want to be
* people will naturally gravitate towards you when you come to launch a blog, a newsletter, podcast or a community.
* when you have that gravity = people join your community!

‚Äå

#### The things are great to know people, but how does it translate to building community?

‚Äå

#### You can‚Äôt build community without:

‚Äå

* Knowing your people
* Conversing with them
* Creating something of value

‚Äå

### Example of a Flywheel

#### On Twitter \(Example\) 

‚Äå

* Instead of subscribing to their newsletter, you follow them. Bonus points for building trust by participating in the conversation.
