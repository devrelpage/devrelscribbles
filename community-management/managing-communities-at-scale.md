* From there, _****_the _**Ambassador program**_ proved useful in building community. 
* _**Educating**_ the community. 
* _**Identifying power users**_, and making the power users feel valued. 

## Scribbles

* _**Investing early in communities**_ helps in the long run. 
* The biggest pieces initially starting up the community were _**templates**_ and the _**ambassador program**_. 
* Two things they focused on: Top of _**funnel sign-ups**_, helping _**users**_ understand _**how to use notion better**_.

* No like for real, there are always people out there who genuinely believe in the product and do not look for any monetary value.
* For folks likes these, being part of the community, contributing toward's the growth of the product is more satisfying than the monetary value to compensate for their time invested in the process.
