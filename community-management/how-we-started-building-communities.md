## Scribbles

### Speaker 1 - _@DruRly_

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

* founder of **trends.vc** -- and the idea of accidental community stands out to him.  

#### How are you being mindful of the content you create? Trends VC focuses on rituals to get people to tap in and learn more about one another. How can you continue to deliver value?

* Through rituals + An active practice.  ****

####  ðŸš© Takeaways 

* Culture is a one-way door, which means it's hard to change the culture once made. This implies that you have to shape the culture from the get-go. Rituals build habits, help shape the culture. ****
* **Barriers to entry aren't bad,** Dru believes in strategic friction â€” price can be more than money, how are we being mindful with the type of communities that we're creating.
* There has to be a vision behind the community so that the community remains focused. Also interesting is that the community he built was hierarchical, based on engagement.
* Removing features that remain unused - going depth-first instead of breadth. This could help them remain focused instead of spreading them thin.





### Speaker 2 - _**@gabysslave**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

* really really excited to hear what they're building at CoMunity! Julia moved into an area where most folks didn't have wifi! and bridging this technology barrier was interesting. â€” Julia realized that her family was harder to connect to the greater world and network.

#### How can we apply this approach to more modern communities?  

> Basics remain the same, keeping people connected, communicating with them. What Julia reminds me is that a mediator might not work that well had she kept pushing a digital newsletter or some tech solution without understanding the audience.

* This is a great way to bring tech to people using technologies they are familiar with. um is just that, a medium. 
* We have to figure those details based on our audience's needs. 

#### ðŸš© Takeaways 

* Julia delivered 150 newsletters by hand if I heard that correctly! Wow! " you have to build for the edges â€” you have to "_**You have to build for the edges, you have to build for the people**_."
* _**Understanding your audience's needs**_, making a physical newsletter instead of a digital one - that's human-centered design. Build for folks who may not understand something".
* Julia is _**emphasizing "Human first"**_ instead of "Digital first"?
* Building _**community resilience**_ is considered in this â€” _**centering in storytelling less in the tech**_.
* Community Funerals in the newsletter â€” which is such a beautiful of actually _**understanding what her community needs**_. Julia shows so much empathy, it's so beautiful to see.





### **Speaker 3 -** _**@robfitz**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

* author of the mom test! Community building has always come naturally to Rob, at the same time he has always approached it from a business perspective.
* A little fun fact -- he started his paid community without really planning for it or when he felt he was ready. 

#### Why would someone want to join a community?

> To get some value from the community. One thing I understood is that this might be a short line but definitely defines the first "win" for your community. Finding ways that we can give people an early win is so important!

#### ðŸš© Takeaways 

* Defining this "win" early on can be challenging, as many community builders find out how they can actually provide value to their fellow community members after they start with their communities, but @robfitz figured it out in the start itself.
* Different people want different things and different journeys! Knowing that your community members will eventually have different goals and take different paths to achieve them, would lead to different lifecycles of community engagement for individual members.
* Community members are actually solving each other's problems â€” @robfitz essentially works to put himself out of a role and tagging community members in where needed!
* Resist as a community leader the urge to answer ALL questions. This reminds me of leadership tips I've heard - great leaders create leaders, so Rob would mean letting other leaders emerge from within your community.   

### Speaker 4 - _**@dmonn**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

* @dmonn didn't set out to build a community but _**stumbled upon the need**_ for a community. 

#### ðŸš© Takeaways 

#### Why prevent the community where there is no interaction from members from getting too big? __

* Over time he was able to really lean into the combined knowledge of his community. 

#### **Does info get lost in slack?**

> ####  I'm not a big fan of slack â€” but in my thoughts communities can thrive on any platform. Slack can lose things â€” have an external worksheet or database for materials.

#### 

* Mentorship and finding mentorship can be driven by specifics â€” there are so many specialized founder communities, folks often come to Mentor Cruise with multiple goals in mind.
* @dmonn mentioned "Connecting mentors and mentees is what we do and our success IMO. Every time a mentorship is formed, itâ€˜s a win for us. Mentors do one part \(profile, mentoring, service description\) we do the other \(traffic, trust\)".
