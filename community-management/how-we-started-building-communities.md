_**@DruRly** --_  
is the founder of **trends.vc** -- and the idea of accidental community stands out to him.   
_**Questions to start with.**_   
How are you being mindful of the content you create? Trends VC focuses on rituals to get people to tap in and learn more about one another.  
How can you continue to deliver value? **through rituals + an active practice.** 

* Culture is a one-way door, which means it's hard to change the culture once made. This implies that you have to shape the culture from the get-go. Rituals build habits, help shape the culture. ****
* **Barriers to entry aren't bad,** Dru believes in strategic friction — price can be more than money, how are we being mindful with the type of communities that we're creating.
* There has to be a vision behind the community so that the community remains focused. Also interesting is that the community he built was hierarchical, based on engagement.
* Removing features that remain unused - going depth-first instead of breadth. This could help them remain focused instead of spreading them thin.

really really excited to hear what they're building at CoMunity! Julia moved into an area where most folks didn't have wifi! and bridging this technology barrier was interesting. — Julia realized that her family was harder to connect to the greater world and network.

* How can we apply this approach to more modern communities? Also — Julia delivered 150 newsletters by hand if I heard that correctly! Wow! " you have to build for the edges — you have to "You have to build for the edges, you have to build for the people." And then understanding your audience's needs, making a physical newsletter instead of a digital one - that's human-centred design. Build for folks who may not understand something" --- love this
* Basics remain the same, keeping people connected, communicating with them. What Julia reminds me is that a mediator might not work that well had she kept pushing a digital newsletter or some tech solution without understanding the audience. WOW. Connecting digital with analogue! This is a great way to bring tech to people using technologies they are familiar with. um is just that, a medium. We have to figure those details based on our audience's needs.
* Can we say Julia is emphasizing "Human first" instead of "Digital first"?
* Building community resilience is considered in this — centring in storytelling less in the tech.
* Community Funerals in the newsletter — which is such a beautiful of actually understanding what her community needs. Julia shows so much empathy, it's so beautiful to see.
* **Summary**: Understand. Your. Audience. Don't force your solutions on them, but let the data tell you what would work. Your goal is not to use a specific tool, your goal is to build a community, to connect human beings with each other. Their needs come first.
