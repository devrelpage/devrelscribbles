# Communities aren't funnels

## Summary:

* Software is adopted not sold in the year, 2020. 
* If you work in dev rel, you work on adoption and adoption requires a different way of thinking. 
* As the funnel is to conversion, the orbit is to adoption. 
* Identify your developers with the highest gravity and make a plan for extending their love and reach even further.

## Scribbles:

* Developers have enormous power to choose the tools that they work with from amongst a vast amount of proprietary and open source options. 
* Developers are drawn to tools that do a difficult job well that have great documentation, complete SDKs and very importantly have a welcoming and knowledgeable community. 
* Developers adopt software first, and often long before they buy it. 

### How is adoption different?

* Happens slowly over time. 
* It can take a developer months to truly adopt new technology.
* People expect to get value out of a product, out of new technology for a long time before they actually go and buy it. 
* Discovery happens with word of mouth and community is really the engine at the centre of all this. 
* Providing both resources for people to learn how to adopt the thing. 
* DevRels work on adoption, we also work closely with marketing and sales teams who are a lot more established. 
* And as a result -- DevRels are forced to think about adoption with that 122-year-old lens, the funnel. 
* And this leads to problems. 
* Applied to adoption, the funnel turns into a downward spiral. 

### Regularly asked Questions 

#### “How many leads came from our last meetup?” 

* Why is it so painful? 
* From a meet-up even a really successful one, the number of leads that you can say you got is low. 
* Could be because you didn’t feel comfortable making every attendee give you their email address just to get in the door.
* You don’t feel like leads are the right way to judge the success of a meet-up. 

#### “Can you share that developer's contact information with the sales team?” 

* These awkward questions come from the funnel mentality, so they’re going to be hard to answer by people like us who work on adoption.

###   Orbit Stuff

* The Orbit Model is an alternative to the funnel that's designed specifically for community-driven adoption. 
* The goal of the funnel is conversion but the goal of the Orbit is adoption. 
* The Orbit Model helps you explain what you’re actually trying to do as a dev rel. 
* Helps you identify and prioritize the developers who should be working with. 
* “Who’s in my community, and who matters?”
* Help you measure and communicate your impact.

#### Orbit Terminologies

* Gravity equals love x reach. 
* Everyone in your community has some amount of gravity, some ability to attract others.
* And the gravity that that person has is a product of two things, love and reach. 

#### Love 

* Love is their love for what you do.
* Expert Knowle
* High Satisfaction
* Part of the thrive 

#### Reach

* Reach is a measure of how well they can help spread love. 
* Well-connected 
* Respected by peers 
* Passion for teaching

#### Orbit one 

* Reserved for ambassadors. 
* Communicate with them via one-on-one, email, even WhatsApp or texting or DMs on Twitter and Slack
* Don’t need many of them, but because each Ambassador counts for quite a bit like their own little community because of the love and the reach that they have.

#### Fans - Second Level

* Folks are passionate about our technology.
* Can easily explain what it does and how to use it.
* Are connected to some kind of work community or local community. 
* Might not have the love or the reach of the ambassadors, but can do so, someday. 

#### Users - Third Level 

* Folks who have some kind of working integration. some kind of sustained activity. 
* Most customers fall into this level, and there can be thousands of them.
* Helps drive adoption for the community, 
* Find the ones that can be promoted to fans and learn how to motivate them.

#### Observers - Fourth Level. 

* Folks who have read our blog posts watched our talks, kick the tires with one of our sample apps or just followed us on Twitter. 
* “At some point in the future, many of these observers might need our technology for something.”
