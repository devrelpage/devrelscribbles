## Scribbles:

* Making opportunities where no one loses knowledge — everyone gains knowledge.
* Language itself can create a sense of hostility in some ways — and something that we should really take seriously.
* Expanding the term 'developer' opens up more opportunities for all.
* In order to get Go-To-Community integrated into the culture, you need to explain the metrics of community in terms of the known and functioning Go-To-Market strategy.
* _**Tracking sentiment among developers**_ — how did developers feel about the product and how did this influence the company strategy as a whole? 
* Community + DevRel =. how you listen to your people! 
* _**Market side vs Community side: Old way of thinking -- Better Culture: Synthesis of Market and Community.**_
* Sharing stories is one of the most important things we can do as community builders.
* The community team is in ways an R+D function

> "I dont think there is developer market, there is a developer community, and we need a community team to reach that"

* DevRel, Community, Marketing = all diff teams...or is DevRel & community manager = same team.
* _**Let the community do the marketing for you**_.

### Potential of having a great community

* Product growth 
* R&D 
* Marketing!

### If adoption is a future success — how can you tap into the future of your org. through Go To Community.

* Marketing will help you grow, but there will be a ceiling to that growth. If you want to grow beyond that, you will need community. The scale possible with the community can never be possible with marketing.
* Marketing is not community building
