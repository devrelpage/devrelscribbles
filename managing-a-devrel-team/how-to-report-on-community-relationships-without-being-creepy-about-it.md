# How to report on community relationships without being creepy about it

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/qB7SMIejAn4" caption="Video" %}

## Summary:

* * _3 Step Process_
  * Listening 
  * Acting on feedback 
  * Optimising
* Anything in the developer ecosystem, things are always gonna change, things always need to refresh, and this is the only way that will keep relevant, and to keep improving.

## Scribbles: 

### Why it can be creepy

* It’s around the business value that 
  * As dev rel professionals, we are paid to do a job. 
  * And at the end of the day, those stakeholders, in order to continue their investment, will continue to ask us
    * “What is it exactly that you’re doing? 
    * What is the business impact you’re bringing back to our business?
    * Continue to invest in your travel, your budget, your swag, and your stickers?” 
* How exactly are we gonna format this? 
* How do we avoid commoditizing community connections?

### Process

* Listening 
* Acting on feedback 
* Optimising

### Listen

* Listening is something that is easily forgotten. 
* When push comes to shove and everything is happening really, really quickly, it’s hard to remember to listen. 
* It’s hard to remember when you are being tasked with a certain thing and expected to deliver, it’s hard to remember to listen to your teammates around as well. 
* Function as a team, don’t function as individuals. 
* Lots of feedback questions 
  * What is it that you’re not comfortable about?
  * What do you think the reporting needs to entail, and what do you want to be able to put down into a form so that we can record what you’re doing? 
  * So, two things that we heard, and these are my learnings, I’m gonna do both at the same time.

#### Privacy

* How far can someone go to violate privacy in order to do well at their job, or to be able to prove their impact?
* Have a reporting program that you can fall back on that is able to respect people’s privacy.

#### Authenticity

* Only trusted people will be more open with their feedback.
* Be more invested to give you better engagement and better feedback for you to improve that technology
* It’s a symbiotic relationship

> _**Oh, I’ve done 10 community connections, “I’ve done 10 trips, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh” it becomes a number. And, by making these things a number, are we dumbing it down to something that is so much less than the meaningful relationships that we make?**_

_\*\*\*\*_

### Acting on feedback 

* If you create something, you have a responsibility to listen, but you also have an accountability to act on the feedback that you will receive.
* It’s gonna be really redundant if you just leave that aside, or you don’t demonstrate how that has directly connected into you building your program. 
* So, acting on feedback was really important.

#### Privacy

* Put in a baseline requirement of how privacy is key.
* Only focus on publicly available information. 
  * Example --
    * Only things that people have posted up on their public Twitter sites, if it’s not privatized. 
    * They posted it on a public Facebook group and not a closed Facebook group.
* Use the GDPR standards. 
  * European standard for privacy. 
  * Use this as a building foundation for you to build up additional requirements that you wanna add to privacy filters.
* Keep the reporting process a bit more open, and encourage more authentic dev rea behavior. 
* Let people continue doing as they are doing without feeling pigeonholed.

Authenticity

* Acting on that feedback 
* Really important to defend authentic DevRel behavior. 
* Being able to provide the right metrics. 
* Metrics drive behavior 
  * If something is celebrated in your company or your team, it’s going to influence the way that people act moving forward -- make sure that you have the right metrics in place. 
  * Authentic dev rea behavior, we have metrics that are qualitative and quantitative at the same time.
* Defend authentic dev rel behavior 
  * Come up with something really creative and new to engage the developer community.
  * Open-ended to be able to celebrate things that are new and creative as well. 

### Optimize

* How do you know you’re going in the right direction?
* How do you know your reporting program’s going in the right direction? 
* How do you then take that and optimize it a step further so that you can not only just meet requirements but also lead the conversation? 

#### Privacy

* Optimizing the reporting process in a sense of being more community focused. 
* But what if we also moved away from individuals as a whole? 
* Reporting --  focusing on the community only. 
* The community is the thing that matters, not the individual. 
  * Individuals in the community keep changing, its natural its fine. 
* Encouragement to become more inclusive in the developer environment and not the potentially toxic behavior of focusing on a few exclusive individuals. 

Authenticity

* Focus not just on what you did but the learnings that came out of it. 
  * you’re centered more on an objective of improving developer engagement. 
* You’re not actually changing the way that they behave at all, zero. 
* Reporting mechanism to feed into what they are focused on, which is improving developer engagement. 
* And, not just for them, but also how do you share these learnings with the rest of your business to say, “Hey, as a whole company, “this is how we can better engage developers”? 
* And, it’s not just what we did, but it’s more important that the learnings and the best practices that came out of it.a
