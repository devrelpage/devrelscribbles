## Scribbles: 

*  If you get unlimited resources and a budget...
  * Probably bad news for your company because they’re not being thoughtful about how they are investing and the floodgates are literally open. 
  * Doesn’t really focus one to innovate as it should be. 
* **What is really scaling?** 
  * Preparing the ground for the next wave of growth. 

### Principles for building developer programs and strategy.

* **Feedback.** 
  * Dev rel traditionally has been an outward-focus function. 
  * There needs to be two-way advocacy. 
    * Need to be able to take the developer feedback and bring it back to the Product & Eng Team. 
* **Community first.** 
  * If you’re able to do it the majority of the time, that itself is good news. 
  * Did you have influence in your Product & Eng Teams to block a product launch if you think that launch is not going to be beneficial for your developers? 
  * If you have strong signals and feedback that the product is not ready, are you able to make that call? 
  * When you are sharing content for meet-ups or events among your developer community, is that the content that you and your Product & Eng Team want to push out?
  * Focusing on the needs of the developer community really helps you win their trust in the long run and that really pays back also in business value.
* **Diversity and inclusion.** 
  * Important -- developer community that we’ve worked with and engage are also representative of these developers that we want to eventually engage with. 

### Teams 

* What kind of personas exists in the DevRel world? 
* What kind of roles exists? 
* **Developer Advocate** is a much more common word being used now. 
  * Folks who go on stage. 
  * The ones that go at events. 
  * At meet-ups and talks. 
  * Go behind the camera and record talks -- share more scalably
  * Public face for your developer programs and your platform. 
* **Community Manager**. 
  * Very quickly, if your product is starting to get traction, there will be a community that will build around it. 
  * Folks who are helping swags for meet-ups, helping buy pizza for the hackathon. 
  * Helping run events if your company has to run those first-party events themselves. 
* **Other roles** -- Developer Program Engineers, Developer Advocates are going and talking about the vision of the platform, getting people excited.
* **Specialized roles like Developer Program Engineers exist.** 
  * In many companies, especially if the dev rel team is fairly small, Developer Advocates will be doing the same responsibility.
* **Tech Writers.** 
  * Call-to-action. 
  * Inspiring someone with a key message.
  * Experience that that developer website has is key. 
  * Having a really solid technical writer team is important. 

#### Expanding globally and scaling.

* Dev rel teams typically get started wherever the host organization is based but then very quickly realize. 
* The challenge is hiring leaders in these key hubs who can really grow your dev rel presence over there. 
* Focusing on hubs.
  * Figuring out the demographic that works best for your program and needs. 

#### Pipeline for DevRel hires 

* Where do we hire for Dev rel?
* Traditional interview formats of either hiring for a software engineer role doesn’t really help.
* LinkedIn
  * You look at people with dev rel titles, that pool is growing. 
* Software engineers in your company who are keen
  * Offer them a rotation opportunity or a short-term project for them to explore dev rel as a practice. 
* Hiring some of the community managers from the broader developer community that your org. works with. 

#### Which org is your DevRel part of?

* Doesn't matter which organization your dev rel team is part of. 
  * The obvious ones are marketing. 
  * Irrespective of where you are, you can be successful if your dev rel organization.
  * Use your influence to land your dev rel team where you would be most comfortable with. 
  * If you strongly think that your dev rel team should be part of marketing, make that pitch early on. 

### Outreach

* That number around 20 million has not shifted in the last five years. 
* Know what are developers that are most relevant for you. 
  * Are you really engaging with developers that are relevant for your platform?
* Online channels. 
  * Events are very expensive, expensive on time, expensive on resources. 
    * Don’t give you a channel to constantly engage with your developers.
  * Explore online channels. 
    * Helps you get a lot more traction.
* Influencers and community managers. 
  * Identify key influencers and community leaders in those markets and build relationships with them.
  * Reach a lot more developers than a traditional channel will probably offer you.

### Operations 

* Dev rel is a job that requires a lot of travel for example. 
* Vendor partners as an extended team
  * Are you booking all your travel yourself or is there someone, a vendor or an agency who can help you? 
* There are organizations that can help you. 
* **Swag.** 
  * Procblem when we have swags being produced centrally, not headquarters. And we’re trying to ship it worldwide. 
  * Way too expensive if your developers are in emerging markets.
  * Shipping cost. 
  * Producing locally. 
    * Has a positive impact on the environmental footprint. 

### Feedback 

* A key part of the developer ecosystem, the work that we do is gathering developer feedback. 
* This is an area where sometimes it’s okay to not focus on scale. 
* Face-to-face conversations where the developers were sharing their pain points.
