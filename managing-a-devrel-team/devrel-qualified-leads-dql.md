## Summary:

* _DevRel Qualified Leads -_ Business Metric To Prove Value
* **IT’S AN ACCEPTED TERM IN THE BUSINESS WORLD.**

## Scribbles: 

### What is DevRel Qualified Leads? 

* _**DevRel Qualified Leads \(DQL\)**_ **-** metrics that reflect the talents that we have, metrics that truly reflect the value of the work that we can uniquely do.

### Why Qualified Leads? 

#### It is an accepted term in the business world.

* Initially, people might link it to the sales aspect of it, but it's better to refactor the term a little than rebranding it because we’re speaking the same language but is also respected by stakeholders and executives throughout the industry.
* Metrics to not lose out on potential leads that can be an asset to the organization. \(. Who knows whether the person you met at the most recent conference will even apply for the job, let alone whether the hiring manager will hire them. Maybe their application won’t make it through the system because of the one quirky thing about their education, or perhaps they don’t click with the hiring manager.\)
* DevRel has no say in whether that individual gets hired or not, it's totally circumstantial, but DevRel can pass along those connections to the right team in hopes that together, they will be able to accomplish a task that furthers the overarching company goals. 

#### It highlights our unique value

* It isn't magic that makes community managers turn into DevRels, it's basically all the things that they already have been doing, that makes them stumble upon that job in the first place.
* The talent of connecting people, bringing people together and making people feeling comfortable and confident and empowered

#### But so what? Who cares? Why, at the end of the day, do these connections truly matter?

* It does! Foundations of communities are built on relationships.
* Empowerment is beneficial for both the community and the company.

> Twilio has invested a significant amount of money into something they were told would never make them successful, simply because they understood the true value of community building: if you can prove to your community unequivocally that you not only want, but will listen to and implement their feedback, you will gain their loyalty.

#### 

#### The need for a single metric that can be used across the industry

* “What are your metrics of success?... "It depends" ... that’s not a _**bad or wrong**_ answer.

> Your goals for the community need to be aligned with goals for the company.
