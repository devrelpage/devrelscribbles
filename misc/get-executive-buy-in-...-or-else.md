## Scribbles:

### Three types of executives 

* **They get it.** 
  * They’re on your page. 
  * They have a clear plan, there’s no question on budget or initiatives. 
  * They’re all in. 
* **Middle ground.** 
  * Understand developer relations.
  * They think it’s a cool thing, I’ve heard it and they’re “bought-in” and I do quotes and we’ll talk about that in a minute. 
* **No clue.** 
  * They’re not quite sure what they need 
  * “Dev rel” and they’re like “Yeah I don’t know. I don’t need to talk about that”.

### They get it. 

* How do you maintain buy-in and make sure there is no single point of failure?
* Because yes they bought in but it doesn’t mean they’re always going to be bought in.
* How can you maintain it? 
  * Communication
  * Internal evangelism 
* Create a Roadbook for your future advocates so they know when they come in.
* What does it mean to be an onboarding developer advocate at your specific company?

### No Clue

* Ultimately you’re going to be fighting an uphill battle, and if your executive doesn’t have that buy-in, there’s not a lot of point for anything else. -- look for another job. ~ Speaker’s opinion.

### Middle Ground

* Where a lot of developer relations departments and teams are right now. 
* The executive is there, they’ve heard of it. 
* How do we measure and execute? Not sure, kind of in-between space. 
* Ask more questions. 
* Make a clear path to align company values with yours. 
* Discussing what success factors look like for that department. 
* Communication, Teamwork, and ultimately, some strategy questions.

### Questions to ask executives

#### Overall value. 

* “Why do you think developer relations are important?
* What value do you think it brings? 
* What are you looking to get out of dev rel?” 
* If the answer’s “I don’t know”. --- maybe it’s time for another job search. 
* If you have that question and they say they saw another company doing it and that’s the only reason they have, that’s a warning sign.

#### Success Factors

* What does a successful dev rel person or team look like? 
* “How are you measuring success?” 
  * And not just in developer relations but in the whole company. 
  * How are they measuring success for Engineering? For Marketing? For Sales?
* What does success look like to the board? 

#### Teamwork

* How is that divided amongst the whole company? 
  * What does Marketing do, what do Sales do, what does BizDev, do you even have a BizDev? 
  * Do you have a Customer Success team? 
  * Do you have an Education team? 
* Changes in scale from companies from 0 to 50, 50 onwards and that could look different at one 50 person company to another, or even 1,000 person company. 
* How is the goal distributed? 
* And are stakeholders goals being represented around the team? 
  * What goals are associated with them? 
  * Are those goals then represented in your team? 
  * How are they being found? 

  
**Communication**

* How do you currently communicate? 
* Are there newsletters that go internally? Externally? Is it all in a forum? 
* You can see how they communicate within departments and how you can communicate as a developer relations department.
* How is communication handled between other departments? 

### Defining executive buy-in 

* Looks different for a lot of places.
* For the purpose of this talk, executive buy-in is an executive that understands your goals at a high level and advocates for you. 
* Not only defends you but advocates for you and says yes I understand what this person is doing, here’s the value they bring in, and I am behind it 100%. 

### How do you get executive buy-in? 

* It is a tough place where people say “I believe in developer relations but I’m not quite sure how to measure and execute it”. 
* You might be going back and forth but you have a path and it may not always be clear.
* Digging in and going back to those questions you have to ask the executive team.
* Help start lining up your strategy and your goals. 

### Implement Strategy

* Program your initiatives 
  * Setting up programs for what you’re working on. 
* Creating measurements 
  * What is it that you are measuring?
  * You need to set that measurement up. And with that reporting ideally. And then
* Communication 

###  Program your initiatives

* Segmenting your developer relations teams or your developer relations initiatives into programs is really beneficial. 
* It May look like an ambassador program or a hackathon program, 
* Different types of events. 
* Education initiative. 
* Segment into programs and then you can have clear outcomes. 

### Creating measurements

* **Developer Engagements** 
  * How many people were in your audience? 
  * I’m giving a talk here so I can report back that x many people showed up and heard me speak. 
* Example - Goal as a company and we want to be in this forum, and we want to measure how many users are on there, and how many active users are there.

### Communication. 

* **Communicate internally.** 
  * Because then nobody in your company knows what you did. 
    * They think you’re doing work.
    *  But you have to communicate that. And that may look different in a lot of different places.
* **Letting the company know what you’re working on is really key.** 
  * Important because they may not know and maybe they missed the email because we get a lot of them.
  * That’s really big and it won’t take much of your time. 
* **Doing an internal wiki to showcase your work.** 
  * Have a homepage page that shows what we’re up to, here’s what we’re working on, and come talk to us about it.
* **Sitting in on other department meetings.**
  * Coming into your partner department and going and asking what they’re up to.
  * Learning about what they are working on once a month or whatever that cadence looks like is really important. 
* **Doing event recap internally and externally.**
  *  Do a quick recap on why you thought it was important for the developer community. 
* **Team meetings**
  * Having an open invitation for any department to come to join your teams.
