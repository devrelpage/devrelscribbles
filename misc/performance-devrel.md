## Scribbles:

### Live stage performance 

* You may need to memorize a script. 
  * Very frequently we perform using improvisation, bullet points, notes. 
  * Take a tape recorder and say your entire script into the tape recorder, and then you can play that back almost like hypnotism to learn the script over time.
  * Take out chunks from that so that you almost have prompt words. 
  * Speak back to the tape recorder. 
    * Helps you get a way of rehearsing your lines with yourself and a tape recorder. 
* Warming up or cooling down before going on stage.
  * Some people need to warm up
    * Getting really hyped, doing push-ups, jumping jacks, yelling with your teammates, screaming backstage in the green room. 
  * Other people need to cool down
    * They need to take a deep breath, they need to have a little bit of yoga or meditation.
* Connect with the audience. 
  * It really helps you calm your nerves and it also helps your audience feel more connected to you. 
  * Making eye contact with an audience member
  * Asking a question seeing those hands raised in the back. 
  * Any time you get stuck or you get trapped or you start like, “I forgot what I was going to say,” look out into the audience, make eye contact, smile at someone.

### Vocal performance

* Podcast, voiceovers for tutorials, calls, sale calls, pitching over a deck, studio recordings.
* Practise tongue twisters. 
  * Helps you not stumble on your words as much. 
  * Exercises those vocal muscles. 
* If you need to do a quick introduction, you can make sure that you know about how long that takes. 
* Drink water. 
* Try out different registers. 
  * Experiment with what voice you want to give your audience with pre-recording.
  * You could try something really high energy, or you could go down to something that is very calming and a question that is very slow. 

### Performance for camera 

* That could be TV, a tutorial , a pre-recorded talk. 
* Live camera with a teleprompter. 
  * LED screens that can actually sit over a camera. 
  * You can actually see the words and not break contact with the direct lens.
  * Might be something you want to invest in.
  * Helpful for things with live data. 
* Get help from a friend. 
  * Some people feel a lot more comfortable, it can be read as more realistic, can feel more connected to the audience if there’s a person on the other side of the camera.

### Performance for a camera with a live audience. 

* It’s a webinar, a TED Talk.
* Sometimes where your primary audience may or may not be the audience that’s sitting physically in the room with you today.
* Important to know your cameras. 
  * Giving a TED Talk -- they generally have two cameras.
  * Rehearse it with the studio ahead of time, so you know exactly which one to switch to. 
* Make eye contact with the audience and look at them but you really got to keep an eye on your cameras. 

### Other types of performance 

* For an audience that’s non-technical -- avoid a lot of buzzwords. 
* If you do have acronyms, contextualize them rather than just say what this means.
* There’s performing through a translator. 
  * Speaking in your own native language and then you kind of have to wait for the translator to speak for the audience and then it’s your turn to speak again. 
  * Rehearsing with that translator can be really important. 
* Performing with an interpreter for the deaf community. 
* Performing on camera live, like for TV for interviews. 
* Performing on the radio live.

### Stage fright? 

* Everyone should get a little bit of stage fright.
* Embrace that fear as a type of excitement and energy because at the end of the day, that is what keeps us connected.
* Nerves can really be a fire that drives us. .
