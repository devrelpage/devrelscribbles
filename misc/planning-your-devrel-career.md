## Scribbles

### Breaking into DevRel

* _**Interactivity --**_ one of the first steps towards DevRel, interacting with people in general, taking part in conversations, helps build relationships -- builds up your resume for community skills -- part of DevRel.
* _**Presentations**_ 
  * On stage presentations/talks
  * Speaking at local meet-ups
  * Podcasts is a very scalable

#### Is it really necessary to get on stage to break into DevRel? Jess thinks otherwise.

* Not all folks who work in developer relations do _**write code or even can write code**_.
  * But if you want to get started in writing code
    * Start a side project - learn to code 
    * Made a tutorial and post it online
    * Working on open source projects or reviewing pull requests.
*  _**Writing or reviewing**_ documentation
* Writing  a tutorial
  * _**demonstrates**_ the kind of _**teaching**_ and _**communication**_ skills I think are _**really valuable for developer relations**_.
* Organizing/volunteering for local events
* Demonstrate some level of teaching
* Give workshops
* Mentor low-code/code/no-code meetups/workshops



### Miscellaneous

*  Whenever you see a _**job listing**_ that _**looks exciting**_ to you, go ahead and take a _**screenshot**_.
  * If you are breaking into the field -- helps you keep a track of various descriptions to asses where you currently stand. 
  * If you are already into the field -- helps you keep a track of what your current goals stand. 
    * Tracks the job description, lower or higher than your current job -- helps to determine what your goals at that point of time were, looking back after 6 months, you'll have a much clear head as to where and where your goals lied at that point of time.
* Make a resume and keep it updated. 



### Already in DevRel

> The first thing is just stay as okay as you can.

* _**Avoid burning out**_ 
  * decent chance youâ€™re getting on a lot of planes, youâ€™re eating a lot of pizza, youâ€™re being offered a lot of free beer can get to you. 
  *  If you can, you avoiding burn-out should really be your managerâ€™s responsibility, but at the end of the day, it's your responsibility.

> Best thing you can do for your future career is, firstly, just not destroy yourself for a job!



### For Both \(Breaking into and Already in\)

* Acting like the adult that you are at most situations definitely helps! 
* Networking is fine but...
  * Can be "Magical and exhausting"! 
  * Networking meaningfully can be hard. 
    * It's easy to spam a certain number of people with "Hey! We are working on this project", here's the signup link. 
    * Developing a meaningful conversation, actually asking them about "Adding value to whatever they are already doing" is difficult.
  * Use personal CRM
    * Never write anything that you wouldn't want others to see.
    * Example of noting it correctly - this person works for this company. I met them at this thing. Theyâ€™re working on this stuff. 
* Creating a _**"Do not work" list**_

#### 

### DevRel forever!?

#### Nobody necessarily stays in DevRel forever

* "Oh, you know Iâ€™m only around for the next six months and then Iâ€™d love to be doing what youâ€™re doing" -- gets fired. ðŸ¥²
* If you have plans to do so, doing it in subtle ways is the ðŸ”‘
  * Write blogs posts about your upcoming interests
  * Talk openly with folks already in the field
  * Continue updating your CV with your work in the field that you are interested in.
    * Doesn't have to be a live version on LinkedIn, put notes to yourself can help you track your progress.

#### Fan-shaped goals? 

* A way to track and build towards multiple goals at the same time. 
* Helps when there are multiple fields you are interested in, for your future career. 
* Mapping out things you would learn along the way for each goal helps you understand the whole outcome in a better way.
  * Map 3 or 4 paths, not 12! 
* No model is perfect, but this will definitely help you sum your areas of interest and your work in it.
