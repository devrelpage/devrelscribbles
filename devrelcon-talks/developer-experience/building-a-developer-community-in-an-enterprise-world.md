### Summary

* Define your community
* Challenge the status quo to reach where you want
* Fund the work properly
* Build the internal sub-community within the organization as well
* Understand the development and marketing relationship 
* Defend the target audience, understanding their needs and advocating them

### Scribbles

* Were more focused on Developer Experience but developers expected community support.
* Wanted Java EE Developers to love their product \(Liberty\) so much that they tell their friends to use it too
  * Created articles, resources, GitHub codes, YouTube videos, etc.
  * Created shared expertise within the community
  * Openness within the community - meeting developers at conferences, talking to people generally, sharing experiences
* Where did it start?
  * Whiteboard session at Devoxx 2008 \(Belgium\) - comparing Java application servers - everyone complained about difficulties starting/ fixing errors and consulting fees.
    * Wanted to create resources for Liberty to get around this problem.
  * Realised that they need to create a more developer-focused website for their community.
    * Frequent updates, adding new articles regularly created engagement, people were coming to the website and interacting
* Motivating the Internal Developers
  * Wanted to get regular content from internal developers
    * But this became difficult for them with a day job
    * One developer made in charge of maintaining fresh content, working a day a week dedicated to this.
    * As it grew, one person was hired full time for regulating this.
    * Made a strict weekly publishing schedule to maintain a regularity \(Made a pipeline\)
    * Executive director motivated developers to contribute to content around Liberty - it worked!
  * Wanted to involve developers to be involved with Social Media, StackOverflow or go to conferences
    * Mentoring them to use the handles
    * Letting them know the use of hashtags
    * Creating guidelines around attending conferences
    * This cannot be forced - social media is genuine and if forced to post/ tweet, it reflects
* Recognising complementary roles of marketing & development
  * Developer Advocates were hugely protected by the marketing team
  * Marketing is good at awareness and hooking people to the product
  * Marketing helps the product to shine but developers need details as well
  * Added a trial for developers to try out the product
    * If registration was added to trial download, 60% of the developers turned away, if not the marketing couldn't collect leads.
    * Cold calls attracted negative reactions from developers.
  * Timelines
    * Building a developer community is organic and long term.
    * Marketing needs to work on short term campaign
  * Metrics
    * Quantitative Measures: Numbers of downloads, visits to the website
    * Qualitative Measures: Quotes from people, their thoughts on the product
* Understanding the users and advocating for them
  * Most difficult thing: Keep the focus on who is the end-user & who is the target.
  * UX Terms: Primary users, secondary users, tertiary users
  * Developers are the main users
* Don't publish everything!
  * It is difficult to say no, but things should be relevant to the target audience
  * Having a clear definition of what is needed, helps in this regard.
* Is it working?
  * Yes - Metrics are going up!
  * More people are talking about the product - getting feedback
